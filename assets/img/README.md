# Image Assets

This folder contains all images for the Harriet Bartley Mobile Hairstyling website.

## Files to Replace

### Root Images (assets/img/)

- **favicon.ico** - Website favicon (16x16 or 32x32 pixels, .ico format)
- **apple-touch-icon.png** - Apple touch icon (180x180 pixels, PNG format)
- **og-image.jpg** - Open Graph image for social sharing (1200x630 pixels recommended)

### Gallery Images (assets/img/gallery/)

Replace the placeholder references with actual images. Recommended specifications:
- Format: JPEG or WebP
- Size: 800x800 pixels minimum (square aspect ratio works best for the grid)
- File naming: Use descriptive names like `wedding-updo-1.jpg`, `balayage-colour.jpg`, etc.

Suggested gallery images:
1. Wedding/bridal hairstyles (4-6 images)
2. Colour work - balayage, highlights, tints (3-4 images)
3. Cut and blow dry examples (2-3 images)
4. Special occasion/prom styles (2-3 images)

### How to Update

1. Add your images to the appropriate folder
2. Update the HTML files to reference the new filenames
3. For the gallery page (gallery.html), update the `data-src` attributes on each gallery item
4. For other pages, update the image placeholders in the feature sections

### Image Optimisation Tips

- Compress images before uploading to keep page load times fast
- Use tools like TinyPNG, Squoosh, or ImageOptim
- Consider providing WebP versions for better compression
- Aim for file sizes under 200KB per image where possible

### Placeholder Images

Until real images are added, the website uses CSS-styled placeholders. These will display descriptive text indicating what image should go in each location.
